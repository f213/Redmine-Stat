NAME
    Redmine::Stat - Perl extension for dealing with Redmine Rest api.

SYNOPSIS
            use Redmine::Stat;
            my $redmine=new Redmine::Stat;

            $redmine->auth_key('your_secret_path_to_api');
            $redmine->url('https://your.redmine.url');

            $query_id=100500; #this is a query with which you are dealing with
            $redmine->query_id($query_id);


            $redmine->query(); 

            $issues_count   = $redmine->total_issues;
            $projects_count = $redmine->total_projects;
            $trackers_count = $redmine->total_trackers;

            foreach ($redmine->projects)
            {
                    print "Project: ". $_->{name} . " ";
                    print "Issues count: ". $_->{issues_count} ." ";
                    print "\r\n";
            }

DESCRIPTION
    This module is designed for statistic purposes only, it does not apply
    CRUD or any other operations. I have wrote this module because i wanted
    to combine RRDtool with my Redmine.

    Redmine::Stat works with Redmine REST api
    (<http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Rest_api>). By default
    redmine forces clients to use pagination, and does not allow unlimited
    queries, what is a bad idea imho. You need some modifications in Redmine
    core for this module to work correctly. Otherwise, if you don't need
    by-project or by-tracker issue statistics, you may not modify Redmine -
    this module will deal with "meta" fields, such as total_count. Maximum
    limit (100) is located as a Magick number in
    app/controllers/application_controller.rb:415 as of my version 1.4.2.

    You may get almost any statistics by creating your own queries in
    redmine, and parsing them through this module.
